# FHIR Storage, Query & Analytics

Submitting WG/Project/Implementer Group - 
No such group, should we create it?



## Justification 

More and more developers start design storage for FHIR data.
Some start from existing schema, others wish to design for FHIR from beginning.
This process a set of tradeoffs that will affect development process greatly.

We hope this group/track will share experience and technologies for FHIR storage,
as well as implenting analytics on FHIR dataset.
