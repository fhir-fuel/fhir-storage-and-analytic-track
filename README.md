# FHIR Storage, Query & Analytics

Submitting WG/Project/Implementer Group - 
No such group, should we form it?


## Justification 

More and more developers about to start design storage for FHIR data.
Some starts from existing schema, others wish to design for FHIR from beginning.
We hope this group/track will share experience about FHIR storage implementation,
as well as analytics on FHIR dataset.

## Topics

* Build FHIR API on top of existing schema
* Design generic FHIR storage
* Feed FHIR data into analytical databases
* Big Data Analytic
